# Code Journal

My daily/ongoing practice and notes in **Java**, **C**, **Python**, and **Oracle SQL/PLSQL**.

Goal: Consistent coding habits — one small commit per day minimum.  
Tracking algorithms, data structures, low-level programming, scripting, queries, and more.

## What's in here?
- `daily-log.md` → Automatic + manual daily entries with practice summaries
- Occasional real code snippets, notes, and experiments
- Built with love (and a bit of GitHub Actions automation 😄)

## Languages & Focus Areas
- **Java** — OOP, collections, algorithms, Spring basics
- **C** — Pointers, memory management, systems programming
- **Python** — Data manipulation, automation, scripting, libraries
- **Oracle/SQL** — Queries, joins, PL/SQL blocks, database design

Feel free to fork or star if this inspires your own streak! 🚀
